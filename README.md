# Inventory Management App

This Inventory Management System is inspired by my experience working at McDonald’s in Bromma, where I saw firsthand how flawed the inventory workflow can be. Products that were thrown away weren’t properly accounted for, and that led to losses that could’ve been avoided with better systems. That experience stayed with me, and I wanted to create a tool that solves that problem, something smoother, smarter, and built for real-world use.
